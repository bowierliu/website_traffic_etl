The analysis uncovers key insights on traffic sources, user behavior, and engagement metrics, providing actionable recommendations to optimize marketing strategies and improve website performance. The project includes data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and detailed insights.

## ETL Process
### 1. **Extract**
- Data was loaded from a Kaggle dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Dataset contains traffic-related metrics for analysis.

### 2. **Transform**
- Cleaned missing and duplicate data.
- Standardized `Traffic Source` values for consistency.
- Derived a new feature, `Engagement Score`, to measure user engagement.

### 3. **Load**
- Transformed data was loaded into a SQLite database for analysis and querying.
